# Reactive Agents Feedback

## Strengths
- Clean 3-layer architecture (client/server/shared)
- 40+ AI providers supported
- TypeScript throughout with good test coverage

## Quick Wins Needed
1. **Document ra-config format** - Most common blocker
2. **Add provider setup examples** - Missing from docs
3. **Simplify basic usage** - Current config is verbose for simple cases

## Rating: 8/10
Production-ready with excellent tech, needs better onboarding docs.
