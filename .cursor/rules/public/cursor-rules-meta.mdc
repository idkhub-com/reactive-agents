## Instructions for AI Agent

When working with cursor rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory, you MUST:

### 1. Required Frontmatter Structure
- **ALWAYS** include YAML frontmatter at the top of every `.mdc` cursor rule file
- The frontmatter MUST include these required fields:
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: [Clear description of what this rule does]
  globs: [Glob pattern matching files this rule applies to]
  alwaysApply: [true/false - whether to apply automatically]
  ---
  ```

### 2. Frontmatter Guidelines
- **description**: Write a clear, concise description of the rule's purpose
- **globs**: Use specific glob patterns that match the relevant files/directories
- **alwaysApply**: 
  - Set to `false` for provider-specific rules (only applies when working in that directory)
  - Set to `true` for meta rules or rules that should always be active
- Ensure proper YAML syntax with no syntax errors

### 3. Provider Rule Frontmatter Examples
For AI provider rules, use this pattern:
```yaml
---
description: Comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining [Provider Name] provider integration with security best practices and current API standards.
globs: lib/server/ai-providers/[provider-name]/*
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### 4. Rule Content Structure
After the frontmatter, structure the rule content with:
- Clear section headings (##, ###)
- Specific instructions for the AI agent
- Provider-specific considerations when applicable
- Security best practices
- Documentation references
- File review guidance

### 5. File Naming Convention
- Use `.mdc` extension for cursor rule files
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- For provider rules: `[provider-name].mdc`
- For meta rules: descriptive names like `cursor-rules-meta.mdc`

### 6. Validation Checklist
Before saving any cursor rule, verify:
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is present and valid
- [ ] All required frontmatter fields are included
- [ ] Glob patterns are accurate and specific
- [ ] Content is well-structured and actionable
- [ ] No syntax errors in YAML or Markdown

## Common Frontmatter Patterns

### Provider Rules
```yaml
---
description: Comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining [Provider] provider integration with security best practices and current API standards.
globs: lib/server/ai-providers/[provider]/*
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### General Development Rules
```yaml
---
description: [Specific guidance for development practices]
globs: [relevant file patterns]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### Meta Rules (like this one)
```yaml
---
description: Meta rule for [specific purpose]
globs: [broad patterns or specific directories]
alwaysApply: true
---
```

## Files to Review When Creating/Modifying Rules
- Existing cursor rules for consistency
- File structure to ensure accurate glob patterns
- Related code files to understand the context

**Critical Note:** Never create or modify a cursor rule file without proper YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter is required for Cursor to properly apply the rules. Missing or malformed frontmatter will cause the rule to be ignored.
